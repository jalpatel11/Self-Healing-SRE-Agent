LangGraph StateGraph definition for the Self-Healing SRE Agent.

This module defines the agentic workflow with conditional routing and
a self-correction loop that allows the agent to iteratively improve its
fixes based on validation feedback.

Graph Flow:
    START → Investigator → Mechanic → Validator
                ↑                         ↓
                └─────────────────────────┘
                    (if tests fail)       → PR Creator → END
                                              (if tests pass)
